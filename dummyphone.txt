To encode go from top to bottom. To decode go from bottom to top. 

Dummy Letters:
“Random letter not in code” means a letter you make up that is not part of the message, “Real letter” means a coded letter in the message.
When encoding:
Real letter	Random letter not in code	Real letter	Random letter not in code	Random letter not in code

When decoding:
Turn code into groups of 5 letters, the last one can have less. For every group get rid of the 2nd, 4th, and 5th letters, and for the last one get rid of whichever ones are there -for example, for a 3-letter last group get rid of the 2nd , for a 4-letter last group get rid of the 2nd and 4th. Then decode.
